        creative frontend development. I am currently looking for a 6 months
        internship from January 2023 . I would like to find a company with an
        organized development and creative team. Passionate by web development
        and its technologies, I would very much like to works on current web
        technologies and discover some new tools, languages, framework, and
        projects architectures. I am curious and I am not afraid of giving ideas
        and my opinions.
